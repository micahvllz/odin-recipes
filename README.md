# Odin Recipes

This is a basic recipe website which consists of a main index page that links to my chosen favorite recipes.
The language used in building this website is purely HTML. Each recipe page lists the image of the finished dish,
description of the meal, and the ingredients and steps to be followed as indicated in the said recipe.

Skills to be acquired after finishing this project:

- Utilize the anchor and image tags
- Get proficient with the absolute and relative paths
- Know when to use headings and paragraphs on the text content
- Use unordered and ordered lists

Self-reflections: Things I have learned:

- Link the different pages on one's own website
- Use image src to display the image and alt for assistive technologies in case the picture has not loaded
- Difference between ordered and unordered lists
- Publish web projects directly from a GitHub repository
