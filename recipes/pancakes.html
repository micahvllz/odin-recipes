        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Look no further because a steaming stack of perfectly soft, best fluffy pancakes are right here! Weekends will never be the same again!</p>
        <p>Every single Sunday begins with pancakes… and ends with leftover pancakes from the morning. These are everything you want in a pancake. They're soft and so fluffy… each mouthful melts in your mouth… you'll be reaching for more than one. Stack. Possibly.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
